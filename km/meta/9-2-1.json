and widely used indicator by researchers and policy makers to assess the level of industrialization of a country. The share of MVA in GDP reflects the role of manufacturing in the economy and a country\u2019s national development in general. MVA per capita is the basic indicator of a country\u2019s level of industrialization adjusted for the size of the economy. One of the statistical uses of MVA per capita is classifying country groups according to the stage of industrial development.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Differences may appear due to different versions of System of National Accounts (SNA) or ISIC revisions used by countries.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>Second quarter after the reference period</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>9.2.1 Manufacturing value added per capita [9.2.1] (NV_IND_MANFPC)</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>9.2.1 Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP [9.2.1] (NV_IND_MANF)</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>9.2: Promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and, by 2030, significantly raise industry's share of employment and gross domestic product, in line with national circumstances, and double its share in least developed countries</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Administrative data from related line ministries</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2014 USD.</p><p>MVA per capita is calculated by dividing MVA in constant 2014 USD by population of a country or area.</p><p><strong>Concepts:</strong></p><p>The gross value added measures the contribution to the economy of each individual producer, industry or sector in a country.
