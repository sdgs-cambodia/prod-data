It includes information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality, domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children\u2019s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p><p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed.
