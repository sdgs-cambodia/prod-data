In surveys, blood haemoglobin concentrations are typically measured using the direct cyanmethemoglobin method in a laboratory or with a portable, battery-operated, haemoglobin photometer in the field that uses the azide-methaemoglobin method.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to \u201cshrink\u201d towards global means when data are sparse. Additionally, it was not possible to incorporate into the analyses some potentially important predictors of blood haemoglobin concentration, especially dietary iron and iron supplementation, because of limited data.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>Anaemia is highly prevalent globally, disproportionately affecting children and women of reproductive age. It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law of 2015, NIS in is responsible for:</p><ul><li>Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;</li><li>Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators;  </li><li>Coordination with line ministries as data producers as mandated by the Statistics Law; and</li></ul><p>Functioning as the central repository of CSDG/SDG indicators.</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>One year after the reference period of the survey, August 2022</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Every five years, The next round survey: August 2021</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2021.

It includes information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality, domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children\u2019s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p><p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed.
