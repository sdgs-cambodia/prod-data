In the calculation of this indicator two methods are used to estimate the number of deaths of under-fives.</p><p>The direct method is used on the DHS data collected on birth histories of women of childbearing age and produces the probability of dying before age five for children born alive, among women of childbearing age, during five year periods before the survey (0-4, 5-9, etc.). Direct methods require each child\u2019s date of birth, survival status, and date or age at death. This information is typically found in vital registration systems and in household surveys that collect complete birth histories from women of childbearing age. Birth histories include a series of detailed questions on each child a woman has given birth to during her lifetime, including the date the child was born, whether or not the child is still alive, and if the child has died, the age at death.</p><p>The indirect method (or Brass method) is used on the CDH? which converts the proportion of dead children ever born reported by women in age groups 15-19, 20-24,\u2026 45-49 into estimates of probability of dying before attaining certain exact childhood ages. Brass\u2019s method assumes that the age of the mother can serve as a proxy for the age of her children and thus for how long they have been exposed to the risk of dying.</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>Data disaggregation is available for various socio-economic characteristics including residence (urban/rural), household wealth quintiles, education level of the mother, maternal age, geographic regions (provinces).</p>","CONTACT_PHONE":"<p>+855 012 867 581</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"<p>National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning</p>","CONTACT_NAME":"<p>Phan Chinda (Mr)</p>","CONTACT_MAIL":"<p>No. 386 Street 360, Sangkat Boeung Kengkang I, Khan Chamkarmon, Phnom Penh,\u200b\u00a0Cambodia</p>","CONTACT_FUNCT":"<p>Deputy Director General</p>","CONTACT_EMAIL":"<p>phanchinda@yahoo.com</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Institute of Statistics (NIS)</p>","COMPARABILITY":"<p>The UN Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME) estimates are derived from nationally representative data from censuses, surveys or vital registration systems.
