Child wasting/overweight refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible.

For the inclusion of survey estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey quality assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the survey is not included until information becomes available. When raw data are available, and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-analysis is performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies between results from standardised approach and those reported may occur for various reasons, for example, the use of different standards for z-score calculations, imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months, the use of different flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a method for converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). In addition, when surveys do not cover the age interval 0-&lt;5 years, or are only representative of the rural areas, an adjustment based on other surveys for the same country, is performed. Any adjustment or conversion is transparently stated in the annotated joint data set.</p>","COLL_METHOD":"<p>The CDHS was conducted in 2000, 2005, 2010, 2014 and 2021. Before the CDHS, similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of Health.</p><p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the demographic and health situation within the population. It includes information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality, domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children\u2019s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p><p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p><p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces. Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p><p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: <a href=\"http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home\">http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home</a></p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>Prevalence of wasting/overweight (weight for height &gt;+2 standard deviation from the median of the World Health Organization (WHO) Child Growth Standards) among children under 5 years of age.</p><p>The official MDG indicator is wasting as assessed using weight for height.  Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on  MUAC are not considered for the joint dataset.  In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral pitting  odema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs).  For Surveys that report oedema cases, in the joint data set these are included in the prevalence of low weight-for-height.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>One year after the reference period of the survey, August 2022</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey Report:  <a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/Countries/Country-Main.cfm?ctry_id=6\">https://dhsprogram.com/Countries/Country-Main.cfm?ctry_id=6</a></p>","CONTACT_MAIL":"<p>No. 386 Street 360, Sangkat Boeung Kengkang I, Khan Chamkarmon, Phnom Penh,\u200b\u00a0Cambodia</p>","CONTACT_FUNCT":"<p>Deputy Director General</p>","CONTACT_EMAIL":"<p>phanchinda@yahoo.com</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Every five years, The next round survey: August 2021</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE":"<p>June 2021</p>","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"<p>Demographic Statistics, Population and Survey Department</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>Adheres to the fundamental principles of official statistics and implements national quality assurance framework</p><p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers.
