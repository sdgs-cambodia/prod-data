At the start of the MDG period, there was a complete lack of nationally representative data about drinking water safety in developing countries, and such data were not collected through household surveys or censuses. The JMP developed the concept of \u2018improved\u2019 water sources, which was used as a proxy for \u2018safe water\u2019, as such sources are likely to be protected against faecal contamination, and this metric has been used since 2000 to track progress towards the MDG target. International consultations since 2011 have established consensus on the need to build on and address the shortcomings of this indicator; specifically, to address normative criteria of the human right to water including accessibility, availability and quality.</p><p>The above consultation concluded that JMP should go beyond the basic level of access and address safe management of drinking water services, including dimensions of accessibility, availability and quality.

The sample size was determined for annual CSES is about 3,600 households. Every 5 years it is conducted with a big sample size is about 12,000 households.
