It includes information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality, domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children\u2019s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p><p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed.

It negatively affects cognitive and motor development and work capacity, and among pregnant women iron deficiency anaemia is associated with adverse reproductive outcomes, including preterm delivery, low-birth-weight infants, and decreased iron stores for the baby, which may lead to impaired development. Iron deficiency is considered the most common cause of anaemia, but there are other nutritional and non-nutritional causes. Blood haemoglobin concentrations are affected by many factors, including altitude (metres above sea level), smoking, trimester of pregnancy, age and sex. Anaemia can be assessed by measuring blood haemoglobin, and when used in combination with other indicators of iron status, blood haemoglobin provides information about the severity of iron deficiency. The anaemia prevalence for the population is used to classify the public health significance of the problem.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Despite the extensive data search, data for blood haemoglobin concentrations are still limited, compared to other nutritional indicators such as child anthropometry (1, 24); this was especially true in the high-income countries of the WHO European Region. As a result, the estimates may not capture the full variation across countries and regions, tending to \u201cshrink\u201d towards global means when data are sparse. Additionally, it was not possible to incorporate into the analyses some potentially important predictors of blood haemoglobin concentration, especially dietary iron and iron supplementation, because of limited data.</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>One year after the reference period of the survey, August 2022</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>Goal 2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>2.2.3 Prevalence of anaemia in women aged 15 to 49 years, by pregnancy status</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>2.2.3 Proportion of women aged 15-49 years with anaemia, pregnant [2.2.3] (SH_STA_ANEM_PREG)</p><p> </p><p>2.2.3 Proportion of women aged 15-49 years with anaemia, non-pregnant [2.2.3] (SH_STA_ANEM_NPRG)</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>2.2: by 2030 end all forms of malnutrition, including achieving by 2025 the internationally agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five years of age, and address the nutritional needs of adolescent girls, pregnant and lactating women, and older persons</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey (CDHS)</p>","STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p>Percentage of women aged 15\u221249 years with a haemoglobin concentration less than 120 g/L for non-pregnant women and lactating women, and less than 110 g/L for pregnant women, adjusted for altitude and smoking.</p><p>Anaemia: condition in which the concentration of blood haemoglobin falls below established cut-off values.</p><p>Iron deficiency state in which there is insufficient iron to maintain the normal physiological function of blood, brain and muscles (ICD-11, 5B5K.0 iron deficiency)</p><p>Iron deficiency anaemia: (ICD-11, 3A00, iron deficiency anaemia).</p><p>Blood haemoglobin concentration: concentration of haemoglobin in whole blood</p>","UNIT_MEASURE":"<p>Percent</p>"},"indicator":"2.2.3","target_id":"2.2","sdg_goal":"2","reporting_status":"notstarted","data_non_statistical":true,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"02-02-03","indicator_name":"global_indicators.2-2-3-title","graph_title":"global_indicators.2-2-3-title"}
