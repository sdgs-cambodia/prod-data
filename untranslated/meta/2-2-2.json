Before the CDHS, similar surveys known as Demographic Survey 1996 was also conducted by the NIS and followed by Nation Health Survey 1998 was conducted by Ministry of Health.</p><p>The CDHS is national household survey covering many areas related to the demographic and health situation within the population. It includes information on demography, family planning, infant and child mortality, domestic violence, and health-related information such as breastfeeding, antenatal care, children\u2019s immunization, childhood diseases, and HIV/AIDS. Also, the questionnaires are designed to evaluate the nutritional status of mothers and children and to measure the prevalence of anemia.</p><p>The survey covered a sample of 15,000 plus households. All women age 15-49 in these households and all men aged 15-49 in a sub-sample of one-half of the households were eligible to be individually interviewed. The questionnaire is conducted in three parts for household, women and men in the household supplemented by blood collection for HIV and hemoglobin testing. </p><p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers. Each team was in charge of data collection in one province or a group of provinces. Coordination and supervision of the interviewing activities were done by four survey coordinators and four supervisory staff members from the National Institute of Statistics and the Ministry of Health. Data collection took place over a six-month period, from February to July in the year of survey.</p><p>The detailed documentations of the survey, such as questionnaire, filed operation annual and technical report on survey design and implementation are stored in NADA (National Data Archive), NIS website: <a href=\"http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home\">http://nada.nis.gov.kh/index.php/home</a></p>","COMPARABILITY":"<p>Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards.</p><p>The standard analysis approach to construct the joint data set aims for a maximum comparability of country estimates. For the inclusion of survey estimates into the JME dataset, the inter-agency group applies survey quality assessment criteria. When there is insufficient documentation, the survey is not included until information becomes available. When raw data are available, and there is a question about the analysis approach, data re-analysis is performed following the standard methodology. Discrepancies between results from standardised approach and those reported may occur for various reasons, for example, the use of different standards for z-score calculations, imputation of the day of birth when missing, the use of rounded age in months, the use of different flagging systems for data exclusion. For surveys based on the previous NCHS/WHO references, and for which raw data are not available, a method for converting the z-scores to be based on the WHO Child Growth Standards is applied (Yang and de Onis, 2008). In addition, when surveys do not cover the age interval 0-&lt;5 years, or are only representative of the rural areas, an adjustment based on other surveys for the same country, is performed. Any adjustment or conversion is transparently stated in the annotated joint data set.</p>","COMPILING_ORG":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","CONTACT_EMAIL":"<p>phanchinda@yahoo.com</p>","CONTACT_FUNCT":"<p>Deputy Director General</p>","CONTACT_MAIL":"<p>No. 386 Street 360, Sangkat Boeung Kengkang I, Khan Chamkarmon, Phnom Penh,\u200b\u00a0Cambodia</p>","CONTACT_NAME":"<p>Phan Chinda (Mr)</p>","CONTACT_ORGANISATION":"<p>National Institute of Statistics (NIS), Ministry of Planning</p>","CONTACT_PHONE":"<p>+855 012 867 581</p>","COVERAGE":"<p>Data are available by age groups, sex, wealth, mothers' education geographic location (urban/rural) and by sub national and stratified estimates (e.g. sex, age groups, wealth, mothers' education, residence).</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Survey estimates are based on standardized methodology using the WHO Child Growth Standards.</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>National Institute of Statistics</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>Every five years, The next round survey: August 2021</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>By virtue of the article 12 of Statistics Law of 2015, NIS in is responsible for:</p><ul><li>Collecting, processing, compiling, analyzing, publishing and disseminating basic data by conducting censuses and surveys, and utilizing administrative data sources;</li><li>Compiling national accounts and price indexes, as well as economic, environment and socio-demographic indicators;  </li><li>Coordination with line ministries as data producers as mandated by the Statistics Law; and</li></ul><p>Functioning as the central repository of CSDG/SDG indicators.</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE":"<p>June 2021</p>","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"<p>Demographic Statistics, Population and Survey Department</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<p>Cambodia Demographic and Health Survey Report:  <a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/Countries/Country-Main.cfm?ctry_id=6\">https://dhsprogram.com/Countries/Country-Main.cfm?ctry_id=6</a></p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"<p>Adheres to the fundamental principles of official statistics and implements national quality assurance framework</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE":"<p>Adheres to the fundamental principles of official statistics and implements national quality assurance framework</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>Adheres to the fundamental principles of official statistics and implements national quality assurance framework</p><p>The CDHS data were collected by 17 teams, each consisting of a team supervisor, a field editor, and four female interviewers.

Child wasting/overweight refers to a child who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid weight loss or the failure to gain weight. A child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible. Child wasting is one of the World Health Assembly nutrition target indicators.</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>The CDHS estimates come with levels of uncertainty due to both sampling error and non-sampling error (e.g. mesasurement technical error, recording error etc.,).

Wasting can however also be assessed with mid upper arm circumference (MUAC). Estimates of wasting based on  MUAC are not considered for the joint dataset.  In addition, while wasting constitutes the major form of moderate acute malnutrition (MAM), there are acutely malnourished children who would not be picked up with weight-for-height or MUAC, namely those presenting bilateral pitting  odema (characterized by swollen feet, face and limbs).
